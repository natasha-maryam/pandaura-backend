Pump Control System - Technical Specification

PROJECT: Industrial Water Treatment Plant - Phase 2
CLIENT: Municipal Water Authority
DATE: August 31, 2025
REVISION: 2.1

SYSTEM OVERVIEW
===============

The pump control system manages two variable speed pumps (P-101, P-102) for the main water treatment facility. The system includes automated process control, safety interlocks, and remote monitoring capabilities.

HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS
=======================

PRIMARY CONTROL UNIT:
- PLC: Siemens S7-1500 CPU 1516-3 PN/DP
- Memory: 1 MB work memory, 8 MB load memory
- I/O Modules: 32 Digital Inputs, 16 Digital Outputs, 8 Analog Inputs, 4 Analog Outputs
- Communication: PROFINET, Ethernet/IP

PUMP SPECIFICATIONS:
Pump P-101 (Primary):
- Type: Centrifugal, End Suction
- Flow Rate: 0-500 GPM variable
- Head: 150 ft maximum
- Motor: 50 HP, 480V, 3-phase
- VFD: ABB ACS580, 50 HP

Pump P-102 (Secondary):
- Type: Centrifugal, End Suction  
- Flow Rate: 0-300 GPM variable
- Head: 150 ft maximum
- Motor: 30 HP, 480V, 3-phase
- VFD: ABB ACS580, 30 HP

INSTRUMENTATION
===============

PRESSURE TRANSMITTERS:
- PT-101: Suction pressure, 0-30 PSI, 4-20mA
- PT-102: Discharge pressure, 0-200 PSI, 4-20mA

FLOW TRANSMITTERS:
- FT-101: Main flow, 0-500 GPM, 4-20mA
- FT-102: Bypass flow, 0-100 GPM, 4-20mA

LEVEL TRANSMITTERS:
- LT-101: Suction tank level, 0-20 ft, 4-20mA
- LT-102: Storage tank level, 0-30 ft, 4-20mA

TEMPERATURE SENSORS:
- TT-101: Process temperature, 32-100°F, RTD
- TT-102: Motor bearing temperature, 32-200°F, RTD

SAFETY SYSTEMS
==============

EMERGENCY STOPS:
- Location: Control panel, pump room, remote station
- Function: Immediately stop all pumps and close isolation valves
- Reset: Manual reset required after fault clearance

PRESSURE SAFETY:
- High pressure shutdown: >180 PSI
- Low suction pressure alarm: <5 PSI
- Pressure relief valve: Set at 200 PSI

LEVEL SAFETY:
- Low level pump protection: Stop pumps if level <2 ft
- High level alarm: Alert at 18 ft
- Overflow prevention: Auto-stop at 19 ft

MOTOR PROTECTION:
- Overload protection via VFD
- Phase loss detection
- Ground fault protection
- Bearing temperature monitoring

CONTROL PHILOSOPHY
==================

OPERATING MODES:
1. Automatic Mode: PID control maintains setpoints
2. Manual Mode: Operator control of pump speeds
3. Maintenance Mode: Individual component testing

PUMP SEQUENCING:
- Primary pump (P-101) starts first
- Secondary pump (P-102) starts when demand >80% of P-101 capacity
- Pumps alternate as lead/lag for equal runtime

PROCESS CONTROL:
- Pressure Control: PID maintains 120 PSI discharge pressure
- Flow Control: Cascade control with pressure override
- Level Control: Maintains storage tank at 15 ft ±2 ft

ALARM MANAGEMENT:
Priority 1 (Critical): Emergency stops, high pressure, pump failures
Priority 2 (Warning): Low flow, temperature high, maintenance due
Priority 3 (Information): Mode changes, setpoint changes, system starts

HMI SPECIFICATIONS
==================

OPERATOR INTERFACE:
- 15" color touchscreen HMI
- Real-time process graphics
- Trend displays for key parameters
- Alarm summary and acknowledgment
- Recipe management for setpoints

REMOTE ACCESS:
- Web-based interface for monitoring
- Mobile app for alarm notifications  
- VPN access for maintenance support
- Data logging to SCADA system
